   1. Game Story Summary
After burning out from a hellish corporate job in the capital, you move to the remote town of Karimlan to take over a dusty sari-sari store left by your late grandmother. However, you quickly discover that strange spirits called the Engkanto walk the streets of Karimlan, not as horrifying evils but as fellow civilians who purchase goods and share local gossip just like any other customer.
Each customer is a neighbor who shares relatable stories deeply rooted in Philippine mythology, and progressing them requires selling the right products at the right price and choosing the right dialogue options. The game contains a plethora of trivia about Philippine culture and traditions, and you must use this newfound knowledge to serve the requests of unique patrons like the gentle giant Kuya Kap, the hardworking mother Mang Ana, the curious travel vlogger T.K., and a host of other lively characters. Fulfilling their specific requests will help you piece together the hidden history of your hometown, Karimlan.
Not everything is sunshine and rainbows though, as Queen Mayari The Pale descends from the invisible city of Biringan to confront you. She reveals that when your grandmother passed away, she left behind a massive debt. The Queen demands full repayment and sends mischievous spirits, like the Duwende Trio, to disrupt your business until the account is settled. You must manage your daily earnings and defend your storefront from these supernatural pranks to pay the debt, and your success determines if you can keep the store and maintain the delicate balance of the otherworldly.
In the end, once you have resolved the storylines of your customers and settled your debt to Queen Mayari, you may finally retire into a peaceful life.
   2. Game Goals
        The main goal of the game is to return all owed debt to Queen Mayari. After each day ends, you are given the chance to return a portion of your sales to the Queen of Biringan. Return too less and more mischievous spirits will start causing chaos in your store, but return too much and you will have less stock to profit from the next day. The daily quota will start small but slowly and comfortably increase as the days pass by, so players must balance between fulfilling the quota or managing the risk of spirits to upgrade and buy more products.
        The second goal is to upgrade and manage your store using earned money. Place the products in however fashion you like, and customize their price for profit or retain the MSRP. When you have accumulated enough money, it is up to you to decide whether to buy more stock or expand your store permanently.
The third goal is to reach the endings of all customer storylines. Each customer has a storyline that the player can follow by simply interacting with them. For example, Kuya Kap will start out buying packs of cigarettes every day, but through encouragement and motivation, he might one day surprise the player by buying bubblegum instead. Completing stories involves carefully buying the right stocks for certain customers, and selecting the right dialogue when they come up.

4. Gameplay Structure
   1. Level Structure – Just one (1) will suffice (must contain Images)
        There is no standard level structure for Sari-Saring Katha. Instead, players progress the game naturally over the days, where higher days mean more story points to trigger and higher random chance encounters to appear. As with other cozy games however, there is zero pressure for when the player is not making much profit each day, as the game provides generous chances to come back up and start over again.
   2. Gameplay Summary
        At the start of each day, any unopened stock will have to be dragged manually by the player to wherever applicable place they like. While snacks, canned goods, etc. can be placed in most shelves, other products such as sachets and candies must be placed in one of the store’s string racks and candy containers, respectively. Frozen products must also be placed in the refrigerator and freezer behind the counter. After restocking is done, the player can customize product prices or set it to the recommended price. After that, the day finally begins and supernatural customers will start coming to the store. 
Once a customer arrives, a dialogue with their portrait appears in the interface. Every interaction in the game feels like a slice-of-life episode at the right cozy pace. The player listens to their stories, ranging from mundane gossip to mythological woes and questline triggers. The customer will then have a chat bubble above their head displaying an icon summary of what they want. Fulfilling a request is a physical act; players must locate the correct item from the shelves or the back-room freezer and drag it to the transaction tray. This simple loop of listening, finding, and serving creates a satisfying rhythm. After providing the customer’s request, they will have a dialogue for additional info and to thank the player before paying.
        At any point of the day, the player can pick up their keypad phone near the refrigerator to call upon their uncle Mario. Through a specialized menu, players can order restocks or purchase permanent store upgrades, such as additional candy containers or new shelving units. 
        Queen Mayari’s henchmen will come at night to collect a portion of the player’s sales as installment to the surmounting debt they owe, and every so often, the player will hear a mischievous giggle in their peripherals, or see uncharacteristic traits in familiar Engkanto neighbors. These are the signs of the Duwende Trio and the Kiwig, who are hired by the Pale Queen to cause mischief upon the player’s store.
        The core gameplay loop basically boils down to customizing product prices and layouts, listening to customer requests and stories, strategically buying items and upgrades, handling mischievous spirits, and managing store sales and debt.

   2. Description of Game Map
The only playable location in the game is the sari-sari store that the player inherited from their late grandmother. However, numerous locations are mentioned by the characters during the course of the game. Biringan City, also known as the City of the Lost, is a central location to the story. Biringan is the ultra-modern metropolis where Queen Mayari The Pale resides, and it is home to the many crystal-skinned Biringan residents loyal to the Pale Queen. There is also the unnamed supermarket and furniture store where Uncle Mario buys his supplies. In the outskirts of the town, there exists the Karimlan Forest home to many Engkanto, and across the sea, the home of the Kataw and Sirena. There are also a myriad of locations mentioned by T.K. the traveler whenever he arrives in town, as he is a special character who the player will guide to a local destination of their choosing, ranging from peaceful Chocolate Hills to dangerous Volcanoes like Taal.
6. Game Mechanics
   1. Mechanics
The entirety of the game relies on tactile click-and-point gameplay designed to simulate the physical management of a store. All buttons are presented on the screen, so the control scheme allows you to play the complete game with just a mouse. However, navigation between the storefront and the back storage can also be handled via the "R" key, which shifts the view to the back of the store and allowing the player to interact with the refrigerator and freezer. Retrieving frozen products involves a specific sequence: the player must click the refrigerator to open it, then hold and drag the desired product to the bottom of the screen to automatically switch the camera back to the front view, or alternatively, click the product to select it, press "R" to return to the front, and then click the transaction tray to deposit it. Fulfilling standard customer requests follows a similar drag-and-drop logic; players simply hold and drag the correct item from the shelf to the transaction tray near the middle window, or click the product and then the tray to complete the sale. Time is not linear in this game, as it is roughly a dialogue-based game with added twists, so time moves per customer instead, allowing players to take their time serving customers.
The day-to-day progression is governed by a strict daily quota system that slowly increases every day, and represents the player's debt to Queen Mayari. Performance in this quota directly impacts the game's difficulty: falling under the quota increases the likelihood of mischievous pranks from spirits like the Duwende and adds the deficit to the next day's required amount. Conversely, meeting the quota has a neutral effect, while exceeding it rewards the player by reducing the frequency of mischievous encounters and lowering the subsequent day's quota, allowing for faster progression.
Inventory management is handled through a restocking mechanic involving the player's Uncle Mario. Players can access a menu via the keypad phone near the refrigerator to order goods or purchase store upgrades. Once a call is closed, Uncle Mario will physically arrive on his tricycle after a short delay to deliver the items. This system operates on a cooldown; if the player attempts to call him again too soon, he will refuse the request stating he needs to rest, and further attempts will be denied until the cooldown expires.
Finally, if there is still time, the cozy atmosphere is reinforced by optional tactile minigames if the development scope permits. These activities focus on simple, satisfying manual tasks such as cutting sachets to the precise amount, picking specific candies from a jar, or measuring granular products by weight for customers. While future upgrades could theoretically introduce stoves and kettles for serving coffee or instant noodles, these complex features may be scoped out to prevent the workload from becoming too heavy for the player.
   2. Rewards
        The main rewards in the game are the cash, called Peso, that are obtained through customer transactions. Completing customer story quests also rewards unique trinkets and objects that can be sold for good fortune. However, maybe the real treasure was the friends the players made along the way.
   3. Failure Conditions
A cozy game like Sari-Saring Katha has no Game Over screen, as the main goal is to decrease stress levels. However, players might not progress as fast as they want to if they fail certain things. For example, setting the price too high might deter customers away, leaving players with little profit. More importantly, not paying debt installments to the Pale Queen will also increase mischievous encounters that hinder the player from efficiently serving their customers. Lastly, although there is no time limit to customer patience, choosing the wrong dialogue options in storylines might make them more reluctant to be friends with the player. When that happens, it will take a new day before they can progress that story again.
   4. Power-Ups
        Most of the click-&-point gameplay is not applicable with power-ups, but rare rewards can include Duwende offerings to appease them for a while, and a Buntot Pagi, stingray tails that serve as a major weakness of the shapeshifting Kiwig. There are also black rice sacks, which can be accepted as payment for Queen Mayari’s nightly visits in place of cash.
   5. Collectibles
        Collectibles in the game are obtained through quest rewards and merely serve as trivia and trophies of achievements. These include the magical white stone obtained from Kuya Kap, the golden plucked hair from T.K. the traveler, and a special certain item from Manang Ana.
   6. Economy
        The economy and pricing of Sari-Saring Katha is a simplified, fictitious version of the prices that are normally seen in real-life stores. This is to stay away from the stressful inflated prices of today, and to better convey that the store prices are different from real-world trends, which must therefore be met with different approaches. The in-game currency is mainly obtained from customers who buy items in the store, and are used to buy better stock and upgrades. Additionally, the player can allow other characters to list their requests as loans instead of paying immediately, and this is a central mechanic in Manang Ana’s storyline.

7. Enemies and Obstacles
   1. Enemy Characters (Minor Obstacles)
The Duwende Trio are a group of small, goblin-like creatures seen in Philippine folklore and mythology, often acting as mischievous tricksters. They are believed to cause illness or misfortune if disrespected, but can bring good luck or wealth if treated with kindness. In the game, they will replace stock with fakes and players must click the Duwendes to return them.
The Kiwig is a Philippine mythical creature from Aklan, often described as a shapeshifting boar-like creature that appears as a person during the day but transforms at night to their true form. The Kiwig introduces a deception mechanic in the game and forces players to pay attention to dialogue or risk losing money.


This is a sign of the Duwende Trio, which will replace stock with fakes until the player finds and clicks each of their little sprites somewhere. Duwendes will target random items, but sometimes target the requests of the current customer. There is also the Kiwig, a shapeshifting wereboar hired by Queen Mayari to cause mischief upon the player’s store. The Kiwig will disguise themselves as other characters, like Kuya Kap or Manang Ana, but their dialogue will often have weird and uncharacteristic traits. Oftentimes, the Kiwig will just waste the player’s time with dialogue before being shooed off, but sometimes they will deceive the player and ask for a request, which, when given, the Kiwig will transform back to its original form and run away giggling without paying. After the player discovers the Kiwig for the first time, they will unlock a new dialogue option to accuse anybody of being a Kiwig, but doing so to the real person will be perceived as rude and might change their mind about buying.
   2. Boss Characters (Major Obstacles)
        The only major obstacle in the game is Queen Mayari The Pale, which serves not as a direct combat encounter but as the overarching objective of the game through the debt of the player. blablabla
